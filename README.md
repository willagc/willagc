- Hi, I’m @willamg, by day I'm a Linux Support Engineer @SUSE focusing on the Rancher Kubernetes Platform. By night you can find me being a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu training dummy.

- I'm interested in automation, TCP/IP, Linux, Kubernetes, Docker, and Cybersecurity. 

- I’m currently learning Kubernetes and GoLang
